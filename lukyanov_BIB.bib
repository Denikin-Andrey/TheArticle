  abstract={A study of inelastic scattering and single-particle transfer reactions was performed using a 63 MeV alpha beam on a 9 Be target. Angular distributions of the differential cross sections for the 9 Be(α,α′) 9 Be*, 9 Be(α, 3 He) 10 Be and 9 Be(α, t ) 10 B reactions were measured. Experimental angular distributions of the differential cross sections for the ground states and a few low-lying states in the final nuclei were analyzed in the framework of the optical model, coupled channels and distorted-wave Born approximation. An analysis of the obtained spectroscopic factors was performed.}

  abstract={The study of inelastic scattering and multi-nucleon transfer reactions was performed by bombarding a 9Be target with a 3He beam at the incident energy of 30 MeV. Angular distributions for 9Be(3He, 3He) 9Be, 9Be (3He, 3He) 8Be, 9Be (3He, 7Be) 5He, 9Be (3He, 6Li) 6Li and 9Be (3He, 7Li) 5Li reaction channels were measured. Experimental angular distributions for the corresponding ground states (g.s.) were analyzed within the framework of the optical model, the coupled-channel approach and the distorted-wave Born approximation. Cross sections for channels leading to unbound 5Heg.s., 5Lig.s. and 8Be systems were obtained from singles measurements where the relationship between the energy and the scattering angle of the observed stable ejectile was constrained by two-body kinematics. Information on the cluster structure of 9Be was obtained from the transfer channels. It was concluded that cluster transfer was an important mechanism in the investigated nuclear reaction channels. In the present work an attempt was made to estimate the relative strengths of the interesting (n + 8Be) and (α + 5He) cluster configurations in 9Be. The contributions of different exit channels have been determined confirming that the (α + 5He) configuration plays an important role. The configuration of 8Be consisting of two bound helium clusters (5He + 6He) is significantly suppressed, whereas the two-body configurations (n + 8Be) and (α + 5He) including unbound 8Be and 5He are found more probable.}

Angular distributions up to about 90° or more in the c.m. system are presented for the strongest transitions. A mechanism of one-step pick-up of four correlated nucleons, with the internal quantum numbers of a free α-particle, in short α-pick-up, is consistent with the main characteristics of the data. Unambiguous experimental evidence, though, calls for at least a partial correction to this simplified picture: the angular distributions of 7Be(0) and 7Be(1) are found to be somewhat different, and the shapes of the angular distributions vary rather quickly with the incident energy. The nature and validity of the assumptions of an α-pick-up mechanism are discussed, and tentative DWBA fits to the data are obtained with a “fixed range” interaction approximation. The main spectroscopic information is that the α-transfer spectroscopic factor does not decrease between 12C and 40Ca. nearly as strongly as shell-model wave functions would suggest."

The unobserved 1 +, T = 0, 18.15 MeV state is at least one order of magnitude less populated than the 1+, T = 1, 17.64 MeV state. This selectivity between the two 1+ states suggests that one configuration only of the three transferred nucleons is involved in the (3He, 6Li) reaction. An analysis performed under the assumption of triton pick-up is shown to predict the occurrence of such selectivities although it cannot account for the one observed using current shell-model wave functions."
